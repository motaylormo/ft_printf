This is my version of the **[42](https://www.42.us.org/)** cadet project `ft_printf` from the algorithms branch.

# ft_printf
Recreating the `printf` function in `C`.

It uses several functions for the previous project `libft`: `ft_memalloc`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strnequ`, `ft_strlen`, and `ft_isdigit`. Because `ft_printf` complies to a library, and you can't include libraries in other libraries, these `libft` functions (and the other functions they use) have been included as `C` files rather than as the `libft` library.
